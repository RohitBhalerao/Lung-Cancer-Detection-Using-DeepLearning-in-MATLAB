How to run the project files:

Software requires: MATLAB version R2018B or later. (function 'training_options' exists only in Deep Learning Toolbox which is available in versions r2018b or newer.)

Open the folder path in MATLAB. 
Open 'guidemo.m' and run code.
GUI pops up. Train/Browse image and Classify image.


**
The cnn.mat file is a pre-trained network on the dataset. 
To train the system again, delete folder 'PreprocessedDatabase' and file 'trainedNet.mat'. 
Run the 'guidemo.m' file in MATLAB. 
Click on 'Preprocessing' button. Images will be pre-processed and stored in a newly created 'PreprocessedDatabase' file.
Click on 'Training' button. A newly trained network is stored in a file created by the name 'trainedNet.mat'.

Important:
**
210 images from each class is preprocessed and trained in the CNN Network. So, select any of the image numbered more than 210 for testing.

For testing-
Click 'Browse' button on the GUI. Select image from the folders named malign,benign or normal.
Click 'Classify' button on the GUI.
** 

**
Folders named 'malign','benign' and 'normal' is the dataset for the project divided in the three classes.
File 'trainedNet.mat' contains the trained CNN network.
Files 'testcnn.m' and 'plotfeatures.m' are the codes which are used in callback functions of 'guidemo.m'
